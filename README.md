# ng2ol3
> A combination of <b>Angular2 & OpenLayers3</b> using <i>TypeScript, RxJS & SCSS</i> for creating customizable, modern web maps

## Usage
First run ```npm install``` and ```npm run typings install``` to download all dependencies ([Node.js (min version: 4.x.x) with npm (min version: 3.x.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) is required). Then simply run ```npm start``` to load the sample page. For using ```ng2ol3``` [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor is recommended with the following packages: <i><b>atom-typescript, sass-autocompile,</b> color-picker, emmet, file-icons, git-plus, keyboard-localization, minimap, pigments, project-manager</i>.

## Present & Future
This is just a basic demo app at the moment. In the near future I intend to add customizable widgets such as layertree, featureinfo panel, printing etc. RxJS is not yet implemented.

I hope you will find this project useful!
