# ng2ol3
> A combination of <b>Angular2 & OpenLayers3</b> using <i>TypeScript & RxJS & SCSS</i> for creating customizable, modern web apps

## Usage
First run ```npm install``` to download all dependencies ([node with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required). Then simply run ```npm start``` to load the sample page.

## Present & Future
This is just a basic app at the moment. In the near future I intend to add customizable widgets such as layertree, featureinfo panel, printing etc.
RxJS is not yet implemented.

Have fun!
